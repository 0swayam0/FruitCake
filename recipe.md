**Instructions**


*Make the cake:*

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease or line three 9-inch round cake pans and set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, and baking powder and set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl if using a handheld mixer, cream the butter and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Add the salt and vanilla. Turn the mixer to low and slowly add in the egg whites. Alternatively add the dry ingredients and the milk, beginning and ending with the dry mixture. Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl and mix again for another minute.
Evenly distribute the batter into the 3 cake pans and bake for 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to sit for another 20 minutes. Then turn the cakes out and cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before assembling.


*Make the fruit filling:*

Wash all the fruit and chop them into small pieces. Toss together and set aside.


*Make the frosting:*

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl if using a handheld mixer, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium speed until well blended and smooth, about 2 minutes. Turn the mixer down to low and slowly add in the powdered sugar. Add in the vanilla bean, vanilla extract and bourbon if using. Beat for 1 additional minute. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill.


*Assemble the cake:*

Place 1 cake layer on a cake plate or a serving plate. Add a mound of frosting on top. Then add about 1/3 of the fruit filling, making sure to leave at least a 1-inch border around the perimeter of the cake untouched in case the fruit oozes out the side. Repeat with the remaining layers. Save the final 1/3 of the fruit filling for the top of the cake as decoration. Frost the cake with the remaining frosting.

**Note:**
Cake should be stored in an airtight container and kept in the refrigerator. It will keep for a few days.
